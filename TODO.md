# TODO

- [ ] When generating temporary files, add them to a list with times and timeouts, so that they can be removed when they are done being used, or at exit.
- [ ] Save temporary files with a specific pattern, or in /var, so that all of them may be cleared (or rotated) at program start.
- [ ] Improve the performance of the crossfading.
- [ ] Improve the performance of the image writing and loading, when crossfading. Look into other graphics file formats.
